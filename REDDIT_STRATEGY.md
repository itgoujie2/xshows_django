## Posting Templates

### Template 1: r/SideProject

**Title:**
```
[NSFW] Built a free webcam aggregator with AI nudity detection that sends real-time alerts
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

I built a side project that solves a specific problem: missing your favorite webcam models when they go live and nude.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates live webcam models from Chaturbate
- Uses NudeNet AI to detect nudity in real-time
- Sends email alerts when subscribed models are detected nude
- 100% free, no ads

**Tech stack:**
- Django 4.2
- Celery + Redis for background tasks
- NudeNet AI for image classification
- Deployed on EC2 t3.small (optimized to run AI on 2GB RAM)

**Challenges I solved:**
- Memory optimization (NudeNet requires ~1GB RAM)
- Lazy loading and worker recycling to prevent OOM
- Efficient scraping without getting rate-limited
- Email deliverability for notifications

**Why I built it:**
Adult content aside, it's a technically interesting problem - real-time image classification at scale on limited resources.

Check it out: [your-domain.com]

Open to feedback, especially on the AI detection accuracy and performance optimizations!

(Yes, it's NSFW content, but the technical challenges were fun to solve)
