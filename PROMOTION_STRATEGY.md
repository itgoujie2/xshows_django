### Quora Answer Template

```
Question: "What's the best way to get notified when a webcam model goes live?"

Answer:

I've tried several methods over the years, and recently I've been using **NakedAlerts** which has been the most reliable.

Here's what makes it effective:

1. **Real-time Detection** - Uses AI to detect when streams start, usually within seconds
2. **Cross-platform** - Works across multiple webcam sites
3. **No manual checking** - Set it and forget it
4. **Free** - No hidden costs or premium tiers

Most webcam platforms have their own notification systems, but they're often delayed or don't work on mobile. Having a dedicated alert service has been much more reliable for me.

You can check it out at nakedalerts.com

Other options include:
- Browser extensions (but require browser to be open)
- Platform-native notifications (often unreliable)
- RSS feeds (outdated method)

Hope this helps!
